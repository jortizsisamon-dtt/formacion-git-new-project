# Git learning course

This repository has been created to learn how to create a new Git project from scratch.

## Update the project to Github

Execute the following steps to perform the first local commit:

```
1. Execute git init.
2. Edit some files.
3. Execute git add.
4. Execute git commit -m "Create new project".
```

After to have the changes locally commited, we will need to create the remote repository:

```
1. git branch -M master
2. git remote add origin https://github.com/user/project-name.git
3. git push -u origin master
```
